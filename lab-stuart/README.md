#  Reddit Search - Lab Stuart

## About:
A simple interface for searching Reddit by category name and returning a list of results with user-defined numeric limit.

## Usage:
Simply enter a category name, like `programming`, and results limit, like `10`, into the form and hit the submit button. The app concatenates those settings into a JSON request, like `https://www.reddit.com/r/programming.json?limit=10`, and formats results as a list of links.

## Dependencies:
